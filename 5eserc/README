In order to make the program work I added an input.dat file that allows to set eight parameters: 

1) the state (0 for ground state, 1 for the excited state)
2) the transfer matrix (0 for uniform, 1 for gaussian)
3) the amplitude of the intervall for the uniform distribution (1.25 for 1s and 3 for 2p are the right one for the Metropolis algorithm) 
4) the amplitude of the Gaussian distribution (0.75 for 1s and 1.85 for 2p are the right one for the Metropolis algorithm) 
5-6-7) the initial coordinates (used only for the equilibration)
8) equilibration (only if it is set to 1)


The file are saved in the folder "risultati". To clean the output go to "risultati" and run ./clean.sh
