For the first exercise I wrote two code: autocorr.cpp and blkave.cpp.

For the other exercise: 

For equilibration: 

1) ./clean.sh if there is an output file 
2) copy config.fcc in config.0 for solid and liquid, while for gas copy config.0gas in config.0
3) copy input.solid/input.liquid/input.gas in input.dat
4) set in input.dat nblk=1 e nstep=1000
5) ./Monte_Carlo_NTV.exe

This is the same procedure that I follow to make the file of the 500000 instant values of the properties (with nstep = 500000)

After equilibration:

1) ./clean.sh
2) copy config.final in config.0
3) set in input.dat nblk=30 e nstep=3000 for solid, nstep=2000 for liquid and nstep=1000 for the gas
4) ./Monte_Carlo_NTV.exe
